# Technical and Design Decisions

## 2026-07-19 — Repository location

The repository root is `G:\antiqvitas`, on the same drive as the verified EU5
installation. This follows §2 and keeps generated content away from the nearly
full C: drive.

## 2026-07-19 — Build command compatibility

The host has no GNU Make. A repo-local `make.cmd` exposes the required
`make validate`, `make smoke`, and `make full` interface while the portable
`Makefile` documents equivalent targets.

## 2026-07-19 — User-directory relocation

The local executable contains the `user_dir` option and an actual launch proved
that `--user_dir=G:\antiqvitas_user_data` relocates logs and account state.
ANTIQVITAS uses that option plus
`G:\antiqvitas_user_data\mod\antiqvitas` as a junction to the repo. This leaves
only Steam itself on C: and prevents the project's logs, saves, screenshots, and
mod content from consuming the system drive.

## 2026-07-19 — Launcher format adaptation

Build 24187685 uses `USER_DIR\playsets.json`; no `launcher-v2.sqlite` is present.
`tools/enable_mod.py` therefore performs backed-up, atomic JSON mutations with a
read-back integrity check. It recognizes SQLite only to inspect and refuse an
unknown schema safely.

## 2026-07-19 — Baseline isolation

EU5 reads metadata from every directory below `USER_DIR\mod` even when its
playset entry is disabled. The vanilla M0 baseline was therefore captured with
the ANTIQVITAS junction temporarily absent. The link tool recreates it
idempotently once valid M1 metadata exists.

## 2026-07-19 — Current-script verification with documented fallback

The installed `script_docs` exporter did not return after two instrumented
attempts (see `BLOCKERS.md`). The project uses the community dump from
GlossMod/EU5-Modding-Mcp commit
`90790df9478a61035a2099c115b21ba7f04c3763` only as an index. Because that dump
is dated 2025-11-07, current-build behavior is accepted only when a key is also
present in local 1.3.1.1 scripts and a real-game smoke test is green.
