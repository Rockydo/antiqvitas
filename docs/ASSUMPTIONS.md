# Historical Assumptions

## 2026-07-19 — Missing installed culture-template proxies

Antilebanon Mountains, Monterey Coast, and Dalai Nur Lake are controlled map
anchors with no installed location-template culture. Their source-labelled
exceptions retain the reviewed Batanean, Pacific-coastal, and Xianbei profiles
respectively for now. This is a technical map limitation, not evidence that a
mountain, coast, or lake had a homogeneous culture. Sources weighed: P8.1;
P8.8; P8.10; OCD; CAH-XI; Pleiades. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 — Dynamic capital names are a limited first pass

M4's first 61 dynamic names reproduce only the `historical_capital` labels of
secure capital-coordinate rows. Pleiades/CHGIS/Samguk Sagi coordinate review
establishes that the installed location is an acceptable anchor, not that every
surrounding location has an attested AD 1 name. Contested anchors and all SoP
geographic seeds retain their existing display name until a source-specific
toponym review can distinguish an attested name from a plausible invention.
Sources weighed: P8.1–P8.10; Pleiades; CHGIS; SAM. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 — AD 1 population distribution scaffold

`docs/m4/population_targets.csv` implements every numeric range in plan §12.4,
including the AD 2 Han census of 57,671 thousand. Its 34 regional allocations
sum exactly to the plan's 230,000-thousand world target. Where the plan gives
only a macro range, the regional split is a transparent working allocation,
not a claimed census: especially the 29.5 million residual Mediterranean,
West Asian, and Oceanian bucket and the distribution inside broad SoP frames.
The installed later-period pop density provides location weighting only; it is
not used as historical evidence. Sources weighed: P8.1–P8.10; P12.4; BHR;
CAH-XI. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 — M4 state-profile overrides

The 45 `docs/m4/tag_profiles.csv` overrides use the roster's relevant P8
section together with the culture and religion catalogues' P10/P11/CAH-XI/OCD
citations. They identify unusually well-attested state or court profiles such
as Roman Latin civic religion, Second Temple Jewish Herodian clients, Arsacid
Iranian courts, Tamilakam kingdoms, South Arabian kingdoms, and named American
societies. They do not assert that every inhabitant shared the listed profile.
All remaining countries inherit their explicitly labelled regional scaffold;
those broad defaults remain contested until location-level M4 population
allocation is researched and generated. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 - Residual societies-of-peoples coverage

The final M3 coverage ledger assigns otherwise-unclaimed inhabited land only to
an explicitly named residual people/society family (for example Caucasian,
Brittonic, Germanic, Siberian, Tibetan, Bedouin, Central/Gangetic Indian,
Southeast Asian, Berber, Mesoamerican, Andean, Melanesian, and Micronesian
societies). These are broad political/cultural frames, not claims of a unitary
state or exact border in AD 1, and are all treated as `contested` until M4 can
model their peoples at the population layer. Iceland, Madagascar, and eastern
Polynesia remain unpopulated as required by P8.9/P8.10. Sources weighed:
P8.1-P8.10; CAH-XI; regional archaeology syntheses. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 - M4 regional culture and faith frames

The first M4 catalog uses broad regional cultures and religious communities as
a transparent foundation, not a final ethnographic atlas. Secure rows cover
the best-attested Roman, Han, Parthian, Armenian, Judean, Tamil, Buddhist, and
major American traditions; mobile, frontier, and many regional folk frames
remain `contested`. The later location-level remap and population pass must
split them before M4 can be called complete. Sources weighed: P10-P11;
CAH-XI; BHR; OCD. [contested]

## 2026-07-19 — American SoP regional coverage

Plains/Coastal and Pacific Coast SoPs are separate from Hopewell, Basketmaker,
and Dorset because the plan names those landscapes separately. Omaha and
Monterey Coast are geographic anchors, not AD 1 capitals. The remaining area
rows are broad cultural-political frames for named Mesoamerican and Andean
entities, all marked `contested`. Pacific Coast has no vanilla-ownable surface
in the installed start data, so it intentionally retains only its reviewed
anchor. Sources weighed: P8.10; CAH-XI. †

## 2026-07-19 — African SoP regional coverage

West African iron-age societies, Bantu-expansion societies, and Barbaria/Horn
societies are separate SoP families because the design bible explicitly treats
them as non-state political landscapes. Kumasi, Mombasa, and Mogadishu are map
anchors, not asserted AD 1 capitals. Their area frames, and the expanded
Mauretanian/Garamantian/Blemmyan/Aksumite rows, remain `contested` until the M4
population and culture layers can distinguish settlement clusters from states.
Sources weighed: P8.5; CAH-XI; *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*. †

## 2026-07-19 — Han-world regional extent proxies

The Han-world pass assigns only frames tied directly to the plan's AD 1 roster:
the Roman/Parthian client edges, Korean polities and Samhan clusters, Buyeo and
Wuhuan, and the Xiongnu/Xianbei/Dingling pastoral zones. Tarim oasis-state,
Levantine, Mesopotamian, and Transoxianan areas that contain multiple active
capital anchors are intentionally not collapsed to one tag. All added broad
rows remain `contested`. Sources weighed: P8.1–P8.3; P8.8; CAH-XI; CHGIS;
*Samguk Sagi*. †

## 2026-07-19 — AD 1 roster entries requiring later review

These entries are deliberately retained as `contested` in
`docs/world_1ad/polities.csv`. They are not yet game setup; M3 mapping must not
turn them into silent certainties.

- **Bosporan succession (BOS):** Dynamis is used as the AD 1 dynastic anchor,
  following the master plan's explicit caution. Sources weighed: P8.1; OCD,
  "Dynamis" and "Bosporus, Cimmerian". †
- **Samhan and future southern Korean tags (MAH/JIN/BYE):** traditional
  political labels are used as small SoP clusters, not centralized kingdoms.
  Sources weighed: P8.3; *Samguk Sagi* conventional chronology; archaeology
  must control the M3 location extent. †
- **Satavahana and Indo-Scythian configuration (SAT/ISK):** AD 1 is treated as
  a fragmented/interregnum phase rather than a falsely crisp imperial border.
  Sources weighed: P8.4; CAH-XI South Asia syntheses. †
- **Djenne-Djenno (DJN):** represented as a settled SoP cluster, not a state,
  reflecting uncertainty over the political form. Sources weighed: P8.5;
  CAH-XI African archaeology syntheses. †
- **Early Malay/Javanese organization (MAL/JAV):** represented only as SoP
  clusters before historically documented state formations. Sources weighed:
  P8.9; CAH-XI Southeast Asia syntheses. †
- **Cuicuilco timing (CUI):** the entity is present for the planned Xitle
  disaster window, with the exact eruption chronology left event-configurable.
  Sources weighed: P8.10; CAH-XI Mesoamerican archaeology syntheses. †

## 2026-07-19 — Capital geometry proxies

Where an AD 1 capital has no identically named EU5 location, M3 uses a nearby
local-map key only after its Pleiades coordinate projects onto the matching
geographic site. These are geometry proxies, not historical renamings: M4's
dynamic naming layer renders the ancient name. Current examples are
Tiberias→Safed, Petra→Shoubak, Tyana→Bor, Samosata→Samsat, Emesa→Homs,
Seuthopolis→Boruy/Stara Zagora, Ctesiphon→Baghdad, Persepolis→Istakhr,
Arbela→Erbil, Artaxata→Khor Virap, Phasis→Poti, Kabalaka→Qabala,
Uraiyur→Srirangam, Meroe→Shendi, Garama→Ubari, Zafar→Dhafar, Taxila→Attock,
Talmis→Kalabsha, Batavodurum→Nijmegen, Venta Icenorum→Norwich,
Isurium→Ripon, Calleva→Basingstoke, and Caerwent→Monmouth. Sources
weighed: P8.1–P8.6; Pleiades; local EU5 raster coordinate index. The nearby
location is explicit in `polities.csv` and may be revised when a closer map key
or an ancient naming overlay is available.

## 2026-07-19 — Area-frame ownership pass

The first territorial pass uses whole current-EU5 area/region hierarchy keys
only where they sit unambiguously inside a named AD 1 macro-region in P8.1,
P8.2, or P8.3 (for example, Italia, the Hispaniae, core Gaul, the Han
commandery frame, and the Iranian Arsacid core). This is a geometry adapter,
not a claim that modern area edges reproduce every Roman provincial frontier.
Client areas, frontier Germania, Parthian sub-kings, and all SoP extents are
left narrower or unassigned until their own sourced rows exist. Sources
weighed: P8.1–P8.3; CAH-XI; Book of Han geography tradition. †

## 2026-07-19 — Confederacy and frontier anchor proxies

Several M3 polity rows describe a people or a broad region rather than an
attested single capital. Their map keys are therefore explicitly geographic
anchors: Naju/Gyeongju/Uian for the three Samhan clusters, Nara for the Wa
polities, Inverness and Armagh for the Caledonian/Ulaid clusters, Heves and the
Lower Don/Caucasus keys for Sarmatian groups, and Otrar/Gulja/Dalai Nur/Yizhou
for the Central-Asian and eastern-steppe groups. They are not claims that the
modern-label settlement was a period capital; M4 dynamic names and later M3
territory rows will replace the display/geographic scaffolding. Sources
weighed: P8.3, P8.7, P8.8; CAH-XI; CHGIS; *Samguk Sagi*. †

Bosporus uses Taman and Characene Al-Muhammerah as constrained capital-region
proxies; both remain contested because Panticapaeum/Charax Spasinu mapping is
not a one-to-one local-key match. Ganzak→Malekan and Corduene→Eruh are
Pleiades-coordinate matches; the remaining classical site proxies are listed
in `capital_coordinates.csv`. Sources weighed: P8.1–P8.2; OCD; Pleiades. †

## 2026-07-19 — Final M3 capital-anchor coverage

The completed M3 anchor registry must not be read as an atlas of formal ancient
capitals. For broad regional peoples and societies of peoples, the local key is
an explicitly labelled geographic seed pending a sourced territorial and pop
pass. Examples include Caesarea Philippi→Antilebanon Mountains for Batanea,
Longcheng→Qingzhou Mongol for the Xiongnu, Pratishthana→Daulatabad, Qaryat
al-Faw→Aqiq, Kath for Khwarazm, Mataram for Java, Azcapotzalco for Cuicuilco,
Chan Chan for the Moche, and regional anchors for the Americas and Oceania.
They are transparent map proxies rather than claims about exact period names,
polities, or borders. M4 dynamic names and the unfinished M3 territory rows are
the required corrective layers. Sources weighed: P8.4–P8.10; CAH-XI; Pleiades;
CHGIS. †

## 2026-07-19 — Indian Ocean regional extent proxies

The current Indian and Southeast Asian ownership rows use labelled regional
frames instead of invented province lines: the Indo-Scythian north-west,
Satavahana Deccan interregnum, Kalinga, Chera coast, Anuradhapura, Han Jiaozhi,
and the Pyu, Mon, proto-Khmer, Malay, Javanese, Philippine, and Bornean SoP
clusters. The area boundaries are inherited from the installed map and are not
claims of period sovereignty at every location. They remain `contested` until
the M4 pop/culture pass and later local historical research can refine them.
Sources weighed: P8.3–P8.4; P8.9; CAH-XI; *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*. †

## 2026-07-19 — Barbaricum and northern-frontier extent proxies

The expanded northern-European rows are region-level political frames, not
archaeological settlement boundaries. They use the plan's named Caledonian,
Hibernian, Germanic, Scandinavian, Venedi, Dacian/Getic/Sarmatian, Armenian,
and Caucasian groups where the installed local geography has an unmistakable
matching macro-region. The real political mosaic was finer and mobile; all
these rows stay `contested` pending the M4 population/culture map and later
local research. Sources weighed: P8.1–P8.2; P8.7; CAH-XI. †
